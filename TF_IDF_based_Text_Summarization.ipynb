            "By Belinda Robinson  The mum of a 15-month-old toddler who got a coin lodged in his throat has described how lucky she feels that her son survived the drama .  Lesley Pattinson , 39 , from Fylingdales , North Yorkshire had to rush to save her son Harry after he began to cough and retch after something got stuck in his throat .  The quick-thinking mum said that she was at home with her son Harry who was sitting on the carpet at the other end of the living room when she saw him pick up something on the floor , put it in his mouth and swallow it .  Lucky boy : Harry Pattinson stands with his mum Lesley who saved him when he nearly choked after accidentally swallowed a penny  X-Ray : The X-Ray shows a one pence piece stuck in little Harry 's throat which he accidentally put it in his mouth  What 's this mum : Little Harry looks at the one pence piece that he put in his mouth which is now safely in a toddler proof container which he will not be able to open  She said : ` It was like it happened in slow motion - before I could stop him he had already swallowed the coin . It 's so strange because he 's usually such a cautious little boy , he 's not one to throw himself into something without checking with me first , usually he 'd show me what he 'd found rather than putting it straight into his mouth .  ' I rushed over to him and he was coughing , choking . His lips started to turn a little bit blue . He was retching . It was really scary and just horrendous , but as strange as it sounds , I was really calm about it all .  ` I 'm not first aid trained but I think as a mother you see all sorts of things , and I knew that I needed to stay calm . It was my job to stay calm and reassure him . If I had panicked we would n't have got anything done sooner .  ' I picked him up and tried to soothe him , while thinking about what I should do . After just a couple of minutes , he seemed to calm down . He was n't gasping for breath , he seemed to be quite relaxed , but I knew that I needed to get him to hospital .  However , the family lives in a remote area so help was not readily available so she had to do all that she could at home at that very moment .  She added : ` It 's a miracle he survived really . The coin was lodged right at the top of his throat . Luckily it went down his food pipe instead of his windpipe , otherwise the outcome could have been horribly different .  ` But because it was so close to the top of the pipe , at any moment it could have flipped up and gone down his windpipe .  The full time mum lives with her partner Dennis Shaw , 42 , and her other three children Marcus Pattinson , 11 , Declan Pattinson , ten , and nine-year-old George .  Super mum : Lesley Pattinson said she is not first aid trained but knew that she needed to stay calm  She added : ' I decided not to ring for an ambulance because we live in such a rural area that I know it takes so long for an ambulance to get to us , so I got in the car and drove us to Whitby A&E .  They rushed straight up to X-ray and from the picture they could see that the coin was lodged right at the top of Harry 's throat .  She remembers that she tried to keep him calm so the coin was n't dislodged , but her son seemed to be fine and quite happy .  She added : ` The doctors decided they had to send him to a hospital with a specialist anaesthetist for children .  ` We waited for an ambulance and then it took about half an hour to get to the hospital , so we arrived at James Cook -LSB- hospital -RSB- around three hours after he swallowed the coin .  ` As soon as we got there they took him up to theatre and gave him a general anaesthetic , and pulled the object out with what I think were like some pincers . Thankfully , they did n't have to make any cuts .  ` When he came round , he was fine . We gave him some milk and because he 'd kept it down they said to us that after a few hours he was fine to go home.Since then he 's been absolutely fine .  The grateful mother realises that her quick thinking actions saved her child 's life and she said that she ca n't believe she was so calm , but she knew that panicking would n't help .  She said : ` You 're all a child has got in that moment to sort things out for them , that was my job and I 'm glad it ended so well . '  ' I feel very lucky that we 've got a happy ending - it just makes you appreciate what you 've got , really . ' \n",

            "By Eddie Wrenn  PUBLISHED :  05:46 EST , 17 September 2012   |  UPDATED :  06:16 EST , 17 September 2012  It is one of the strangest photographs returned from Mars yet - giving a snapshot of what Mars was like when it had a dynamic surface .  The small spherical objects in this image from Opportunity - still scouring the surface of Mars after nearly 10 years on the Red Planet - are tiny mineral-rich nodules , nicknamed ` blueberries ' by NASA , which are sticking out of the face of a crater .  Now the Opportunity has been joined by the Curiosity - but the older brother is still proving its worth , capturing the geological formations which show how Mars was once a wet world with surface water .  The ` spherules ' are small - only three millimetres across each - and have been magnified for this image , which shows an area only 2.4 inches -LRB- 6 centimeters -RRB- across .  They appeared on an outcrop called ` Kirkwood ' in the Cape York segment of the western rim of Endeavour Crater .  Martnan ` blueberries ' : This is a 2.4 inches -LRB- 6cms -RRB- patch of outcrop on the western rim of Endeavour Crater . The individual spherules are up to about three millimeters in diameter  The Microscopic Imager took the component images during the 3,064 th Martian day of Opportunity 's travels - September 6th by Earth time .  Opportunity discovered spherules at its landing site more than eight-and-a-half years earlier , and they were promptly nicknamed ` blueberries ' .  They provided important evidence about long-ago wet environmental conditions on Mars because researchers using Opportunity 's science instruments identified them as concretions rich in the mineral ` hematite ' , which was deposited by water saturating the bedrock .  However these spherules are different - they do not have the iron-rich composition of the blueberries , and also differ in concentration , distribution and structure .  Some of the spherules in this image have been partially eroded away , revealing concentric internal structure .  Landscape : Opportunity captured this image of rock fins near Kirkwood in July  Opportunity 's science team plans to use the rover for further investigation of these spherules to determine what evidence they can provide about ancient Martian environmental conditions .  Opportunity 's principal investigator , Steve Squyres of Cornell University , said : ` This is one of the most extraordinary pictures from the whole mission .  Self-portrait : This picture shows Opportunity casting a shadow on the rim of Endeavour Crater  ` Kirkwood is chock full of a dense accumulation of these small spherical objects . Of course , we immediately thought of the blueberries , but this is something different . We never have seen such a dense accumulation of spherules in a rock outcrop on Mars . '  The Martian blueberries found elsewhere by Opportunity are concretions formed by action of mineral-laden water inside rocks , evidence of a wet environment on early Mars .  Concretions result when minerals precipitate out of water to become hard masses inside sedimentary rocks . Many of the Kirkwood spheres are broken and eroded by the wind . Where wind has partially etched them away , a concentric structure is evident .  Opportunity used the microscopic imagern its arm to look closely at Kirkwood . Researchers checked the spheres ' composition by using an instrument called the Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer on Opportunity 's arm .  Squyres added : ` They seem to be crunchy on the outside , and softer in the middle. , They are different in concentration . They are different in structure . They are different in composition . They are different in distribution .  ` So , we have a wonderful geological puzzle in front of us . We have multiple working hypotheses , and we have no favorite hypothesis at this time . It 's going to take a while to work this out , so the thing to do now is keep an open mind and let the rocks do the talking . '  Just past Kirkwood lies another science target area for Opportunity .  The location is an extensive pale-toned outcrop in an area of Cape York where observations from orbit have detected signs of clay minerals .  That may be the rover 's next study site after Kirkwood . Four years ago , Opportunity departed Victoria Crater , which it had investigated for two years , to reach different types of geological evidence at the rim of the much larger Endeavour Crater .

            "By Jill Reilly  PUBLISHED :  10:19 EST , 10 August 2012   |  UPDATED :  13:14 EST , 10 August 2012  The so-called ` Naked Rambler ' Stephen Gough refused to put on clothes during a court appearance today telling the judge being nude gives him ` freedom . '  The 53-year-old , from Eastleigh in Hampshire , earned the nickname by walking unclothed from Land 's End to John O'Groats after quitting his job as a lorry driver .  Appearing at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court ahead of his trial later this month , he told Sheriff Richard McFarlane that he would ` absolutely not ' put clothes on as he was ` dressed appropriately ' wearing nothing at all .  Staying true to his beliefs : The former Royal Marine , 53 , appeared naked at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court ahead of his trial later this month , following his arrest on July 20th in Townhill , Dunfermline  The former Royal Marine was charged with breach of the peace , with prosecutors claiming he refused to put on clothing or move away from a children 's play park in Townhill , Dunfermline last month .  Gough entered the court naked , apart from brown walking boots and a pair of white socks , and was lead to the dock where he sat down on a white bath towel .  Sheriff McFarlane said to Gough : ` You appear unclothed . Is there a reason for that ? Can you tell me what that might be ? '  Gough replied : ` Freedom . '  The Sheriff said : ` That 's not appropriate in a court of law , there are standards that need to be adhered to and that does not meet those .  He told Gough that he could be charged with a contempt of court , but the naked ramber insisted ' I think I am dressed appropriately . '  Naked and proud : Gough , from Eastleigh in Hampshire , who made his name by walking nude from Land 's End to John O'Groats in 2003  To which the Sheriff replied : ` You 're not dressed at all . '  But Gough insisted : ` And I think that is appropriate . '  When Sheriff McFarlane asked Gough to reconsider his decision to stand in court naked , Gough refused to change his stance , adding : ' I will not put clothes on , absolutely not . '  Depute fiscal Brian Robertson said that he would not take action in the contempt matter , leaving the matter to the Sheriff instead .  But told the court that the crown was prepared for trial .  Sheriff McFarlane asked Gough if he would like to see a lawyer , in light of the contempt matters .  But the rambler insisted he did n't need to see a lawyer , and was sticking to his plea of not guilty .  It is alleged that in July this year , Gough committed a breach of the peace by conducting himself in a disorderly manner and walking naked in a public place .  It is claimed that he was close to a children 's play park at the time , and refused to put on clothing or move away from the park .  In trouble with the law : Gough went on to be arrested and jailed on a number of occasions for walking naked , and refusing to get dressed in court  Gough , who has received 17 convictions in 10 years , came to notoriety during his naked walk from Land 's End to John O'Groats in 2003 .

The algorithm measures each speech 's word count , sentence length , and word syllables and then assigns a numerical grade parallel with educational level .  Comprable : Obama 's speeches measure only slightly more sophisticated than former president George Bush who was criticized for making poor public addresses to the nation  Data : Bush -LRB- red -RRB- and Obama -LRB- blue were graded similarly numerically in trms of speech sophistication  Vocativ reports that a number grade four indicates that the speech could be understood by a fourth-grader .

            "By Richard Spillett  An electronic cigarette that exploded while charging in a car has prompted fresh safety fears over the product .  Carer Kim Taylor , 54 , left the device on charge for just ten minutes before she noticed flames and thick black smoke billowing from the vehicle .  No one was inside at the time , but the back seat was completely melted and the mother-of-two was horrified at the thought she and her family could have been injured .  Scroll down for video  Safety fear : Kim Taylor and her son Jake , 11 , had to extinguish a fire in her car after an e-cigarette exploded  ` I 've gone to sleep with it plugged in before , ' she said . ` I hate to think what would have happened if it had exploded next to me . '  The battery-powered product is billed as a healthy alternative to real cigarettes as users inhale nicotine with no tar , tobacco or carbon monoxide .  But there have been several cases of the device exploding while on charge and it is thought to have claimed its first victim in November last year .  Fire chiefs said the blaze that killed 68-year-old Evelyn Raywood was started by an e-cigarette battery pack left charging at her care home in Chesterfield , Derbyshire .  Dangerous : Miss Taylor said the explosion and resulting fire filled the car with foul-smelling smoke  Miss Taylor , from Leicester , had put her e-cigarette on charge in an auxiliary socket in the back of her Ford Mondeo during a short drive .  ` I 've gone to sleep with it plugged in before . I hate to think what would have happened if it had exploded next to me '  Kim Taylor  When she arrived home she left it there for a further ten minutes -- and it was only when she returned to the vehicle by chance that she realised it was on fire .  With her son Jake , 11 , she threw water on the blaze but the e-cigarette had already ` exploded into bits and melted into the carpet ' .  The e-cigarette and charger were made by Prestige Vaping but the car adapter plug was bought elsewhere .  Concerns : Miss Taylor , a 54-year-old carer now fears for her family 's safety when around the devices  Yasin Patel , director of Prestige Vaping , said it had sold thousands of the same starter pack Miss Taylor bought -- and this was the first time a problem had occurred .  ` If the appropriate charger was used we would take further action '  Yasin Patel , Prestige Vaping  He said the firm sold car adapters that must be used with the device , as stated in the user manual , adding : ` If the appropriate charger was used we would take further action . '  Miss Taylor , who also has a daughter aged 26 , claims neither the e-cigarette nor charger came with a manual .  Philip Le Shirley , from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents , said : ` It is important not to leave e-cigarettes to charge unattended . '  The latest incident comes just a week after fire crews investigating a fire in East London said they believe the blaze was started by an e-cigarette on charge .  More than 20 firefighters tackled the fire in a ground floor flat in Barking and rescued a woman , who was taken to hospital with smoke inhalation and shock .  Fire chiefs investigating the incident said they believe an e-cigarette could have overheated while it was plugged into a mains socket .  London fire chiefs believe this e-cigarette charger may have been behind a blaze in Barking  Earlier this month , a pensioner was engulfed in flames on a ward at the Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester in another incident .  It is believed 65-year-old Jean Booth used an e-cigarette while she was on oxygen in her hospital bed and was left badly burned .  Just two weeks earlier , an e-cigarette exploded in a barmaid 's face while it was being charged near the bar of a pub in Richmond , North Yorkshire .  Barmaid Laura Baty was burned when her e-cigarette exploded while it was charging  Laura Baty , 18 , managed to quickly turn away from the flames - but was left with a burnt dress and a injured arm .  Following the spate of incidents , fire investigator Charlie Pugsley said : ` People assume e-cigarettes are much safer than ordinary cigarettes , and in most cases they are .  ` The danger is that people sometimes use incorrect chargers which runs the risk of over-charging , which can potentially have explosive results .
